Hello there our team called asciiforcode! 

Basically our code cosists of 3 main parts, first part is the part of the map that could be modified by the admin, (also we did not added all the 600 addresses to our system, cause its too long, but we can if it is neccessary for win), also we used phpmyadmin db;
Then, the second part of our system is the main page system which is link to all of the other pages. 
finally, third feature of the code is possibillity to add or delete/download the certificates (the uploaded certificate will be at the db, also at the folder so everyone can dowload the certificate from website)
